Hello Cloud Security Community!

The Call For Papers for fwd:cloudsec 2023 is now open! Read about our CFP themes for this year & submit your ideas here: https://fwdcloudsec.org/cfp.html

Final deadline for submissions is April 28th. If you're a first time speaker, we encourage you to get your submission in by March 24th. For those that have never spoken at an international conference before and get your submission in by this date, we’ll share review committee feedback in-depth and provide you a point of contact on the review committee who can offer suggestions to hone your talk for the fwd:cloudsec audience.

Our main theme for this year is “Blurring Lines.” We’re especially interested in talks that show how we’re navigating the changing boundaries in our cloud environments -- and the evolution in “shared responsibility” as a result. We’re also looking for other creative ideas on how we can facilitate discussion and solve problems together as the cloud security community.

We’re mindful of the reality that company budgets for continuing education & attending conferences might be getting cut this year. As such, we’re setting aside a limited number of hotel rooms for speakers that are paying out of their own pocket to attend our conference. We don’t want travel costs to be a hindering factor for people submitting great talks.

Speakers get a free ticket, so submit a talk idea! But if you'd rather take the gamble of pressing refresh repeatedly on the ticket sales website, we'll announce the dates soon for ticket sales.
