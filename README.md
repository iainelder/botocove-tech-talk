# Botocove Tech Talk

This repo stores my resources and notes to speak about Botocove at technical conferences.

Botocove is tool for AWS administrators and security auditors who are also Python programmers.It runs Boto3 functions across selected accounts and regions and collects the results.

I develop the slides for the presentation using [Marp](https://marp.app/).

To preview the presentation, start a terminal session in the repo root and run:

```bash
marp --server .
```

Wait for the message `Botocove_Slides.md processed.`.

Marp serves the presentation as HTML from a local HTTP server.

View the presentation in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080/Botocove_Slides.md`.

Click the lectern icon in the presnetation controls to open a second browser window with the speaker's view including speech cues.
